				<p>ARE WE REALLY AT RISK OF BECOMING THE 6TH MASS EXTINCTION ?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>When we were told that we were going to work on environmental issues, we immediately thought about the future and the coming consequences of climate change. Of course, since we are human, thus self-centered, we wondered about the future of the human race, which les us to study the 6th mass extinction. To avoid ending up like the dinosaurs – dead – we decided it was time to raise awareness and propose solutions to save our species and our planet. There have been 5 mass extinctions so far; 5 times where at least 50 percent of the living species on Earth have completely disappeared in a very short geological period. Right now, the extinction speed rate is going a thousand times faster than it has in the past.

			<div class="section">
				<div class="article">
					<p>1) Climate Change and the Future</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>Humans are the ones to blame for what is happening. The 3 main issues of climate change are rising sea levels, increasing risks of high temperatures and changes in phenology. The cause of climate change is global warming which is caused by the greenhouse effect. Without it, the average temperature of our planet would be 00 Fahrenheit. The problem is that our daily human activities maximize the greenhouse effect. Consequently, if human behaviors don’t change, the population of people from both polar poles will have to move due to rising temperatures and flooded lands. Those mass migrations would lead to overpopulated areas with poor sanitary conditions and low global food supplies, resulting in wars and ultimately the human extinction.
					</p>
					
					<p>2) Human Behaviors</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>Our constant burning of fossil fuels has created a layer in our atmosphere of CO2, which we know absorbs heat, so this layer has been trapping and absorbing more and more heat every year. Some people may believe this to be “fake news”, but if we look around us, we can clearly see and feel the effects. For instance, looking at the United States, California and Florida are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and no rain have caused California’s wildfires to increase in size and duration. The “wildfire seasons” have become longer and more violent due to the lack of precipitation and abundance of droughts in the area. In 2018, the state record was broken for having an area of over a thousand square miles burned. In Florida, it may not be a risk of fires but hurricanes. The “hurricane season” is no longer 1 month out of the year, but getting up to 3 or 4 months of tropical storms. As temperatures rise, the more often these storms will reach Category Fives.
					</p>
					
					<p>3) Currrent Effects on Humans</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>We may be in the beginning stages of mass extinction, but we will not die tomorrow. We are currently feeling the effects of climate change and it’s a problem. Climate change has physical consequences and it also affects our behavior as a species. With the increase of heat waves each year, the temperature of the air around us also rises and this has bad effects on humans. This can cause fainting spells or even death for those with health issues or in weak condition. We, now, see this problem more often than before. Also, with heat waves, more people are less inclined to procreate thus
					affecting the fertility rate. Many don’t necessarily want to leave a dying/sick world for their children to grow up in or one where people don’t care about our beautiful Mother Earth. Indeed, ecological issues do directly affect people’s behaviors.
					</p>
					
					<p>4) Human Scale Solutions</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>There are many simple ways to take action against climate change. These steps can be taken by anyone. People could start taking the train instead of domestic flights because planes emit 300 times more CO2 than a train. Trains pollute less with 12 pounds of CO2 per mile compared to a plane’s 360 pounds per mile. Going to work, we could be care-free by finding other alternative modes of transportation – like trams. Changing our diet could also help, seeing as cattle ranching emits the third largest amount of greenhouse gases. As well as changing our shopping habits by not buying single-use products could be a good start. Other ways include participating in demonstrations, recycling, saving water and buying FSC controlled timber. This would be “one small step for man” to take and “one giant leap for mankind”.
					</p>
					
					<p>5) Worldwide Solutions</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>Thank God there are solutions requiring no fancy technology, just giving back to Mother Earth what we have taken from her – restoring ecosystems and species. We must restore forests in order to protect us from natural disasters; trees can help in slowing down dense wildfires and protecting us from violent tropical storms. Also, we should take action by restoring coastal habitats. Mangroves may be completely wiped out in a hundred years. They secure CO2 40 times faster than tropical forests, storing it deep underground. When they are destroyed, they release tons of century-old carbon. Another solution would be to restore diversity into our ecosystem once again by re-introducing key species. 83 percent of mammals have disappeared because of humans. Restoring even a fraction of what we have caused to go extinct would help set our wrongs right again. Diversity is what balances an ecosystem and we are in short supply.

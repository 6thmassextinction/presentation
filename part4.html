					<p>Simple Ways to Act on Climate Change</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>Climate change is real and we need to start to act now. Everybody can do something. We can start to make little changes in our ways of life. These little actions are easy and very efficient. The road towards that transition includes daily decisions within your reach – like driving and flying less, switching to a ‘green’ energy provider and changing what you eat and buy.
					</p>
					
					<p>Hence, people could start taking the train instead of domestic flights because planes emit 300 times more CO₂ than a train on the same distance. On a distance of 1 kilometer, trains pollute less with 11 grams of CO₂ per mile compared to a plane’s 360 grams. The takeoff and the landing consume a lot of kerosene. Going to work, we could be car-free by finding other alternative modes of transportation - like trams, bus, trains, carpool, bike, on foot, etc.
					</p>
					
					<p>The second way to reduce our ecological impact is to change our diet. The food industry and particularly the meat and dairy industry is one of the most polluting contributors. If cattle were their own nation, they would be the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. This industry contributes to global warming and climate change in three ways: Firstly, cows’ burping from processing food releases a lot of methane, which is a greenhouse gas. Secondly, cows are fed with other potential sources of food like maize, wheat, and soy, which makes for an inefficient process. Thirdly and finally, cows and their food need a lot of water and fertilizers and it leads to big releases of greenhouse gases.
					So, to reduce this problem, we could start to eat less meat or even better, becoming vegetarian by reducing your consumption of meat by half, you can cut your diet's carbon footprint by more than 40%.
					You can also start to eat food that is both locally grown and seasonal, because international transport (including maritime and air shipping) is far more polluting than local produce. Remember to try to not use too much food packaging: food packaging makes up almost two thirds of total packaging waste in the United States.
					</p>
					
					<p>Another way to reduce this carbon footprint is by starting shopping differently. The clothing sector represents around 3% of the world’s global production emissions of CO2. This big number comes from the production, the transformation and the transportation. The solution is easy: you can stop using single-use products, you can buy second-hand clothes.
					</p>
					
					<p>We can also talk about small details like using reusing bags: plastic bags can suffocate animals who get stuck in them and it also takes a while for plastic bags to decompose. You can save water: turn off the faucet when you’re brushing your teeth or do not take baths, take showers instead. 
					</p>
					
					<p>We can also start to clean our houses in a different way: instead of using common household cleaning products which are indoor pollutants that can hurt the environment, you can start to use water and vinegar: this mix is eco-friendly. You can buy a water bottle. Each year, 17 million barrels of oil are used in the production of disposable water bottles. Be part of the solution by investing in a water bottle (BPA-free if possible)—and actually remember to carry it with you. The best flasks are the ones in glass: they last longer and are easier to recycle.
					Change your light bulbs to more eco-friendly ones. Do not waste napkins!  If everyone in the USA used one less napkin a day, current figures show that it could save a billion pounds of space in landfills.
					Reduce your junk mail: an average American citizen receives 40 pounds of junk mail per year, which is a lot a paper wasted. You can register for services that reduce the amount of junk mail you receive, and it will be beneficial for the environment.
					</p>
					
					<p>To conclude, we should never forget that, if everyone starts to act little by little by taking different actions and finding simple solutions, we can reduce our ecological impact. If everyone starts to reduce their ecological impact, then maybe we will have a more positive future. This would be “one small step for man” to take and “one giant leap for mankind”.
